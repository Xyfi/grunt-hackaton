# Hackathon - 9 mei 2019

This branch contains a simple setup for Grunt.

Steps used to create this repository:
`yarn init` - to initialize the `package.json`
`yarn add grunt` - to add Grunt

Created a simple `Gruntfile.js` with only bare-minimal configuration.

Added a `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules`, `yarn.lock` and `yarn-error.log` as these should not live in the repository.

Added a `README.md` to explain what steps were taken to create this state.
